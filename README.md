## 👨‍💻 Developed by: [Rohith Gowtham G](https://github.com/rohithgowthamg4927)

## 📋 Overview

A comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) built with React, TypeScript, and Express.js. The system provides a robust platform for managing educational content, courses, and student progress with role-based access control.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v23 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- AWS account (for S3 storage)
- PostgreSQL database

### ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lms-egain.git
cd lms-egain
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd lms-egain
npm i or npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
# Copy the example environment files
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Configure your environment variables in `.env`:

- Set up AWS credentials for S3 storage
- Configure your database connection
- Set up JWT secret

5. Set up the database:

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev
```

6. Start the development servers:

```bash
# Start backend server
cd backend
npm run dev

# Start frontend server
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at:

- Frontend: http://localhost:8080 
- Backend: http://localhost:3001

### 📊 Database Schema

The system employs a relational database design that efficiently handles complex relationships between various entities. Key design patterns include:

- **Role-Based Access Control**: A flexible user-role system that supports multiple roles (Admin, Instructor, Student) with different permission levels.
- **Course Management**: Hierarchical structure linking courses to categories, with support for multiple batches and dynamic enrollment tracking.
- **Resource Organization**: Structured storage system that maintains relationships between resources, batches, and users while tracking metadata and access permissions.
- **Schedule Management**: Integrated scheduling system that links batches, instructors, and students while maintaining attendance records.
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive tracking of creation and modification timestamps for all entities.

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

The system implements a comprehensive security architecture:

### 🔑 JWT-Based Authentication

- Secure token generation using RS256 algorithm
- Token payload includes user ID, role, and expiration time
- Refresh token mechanism for seamless session management
- Automatic token renewal for active sessions

### 👥 Role-Based Access Control

- Granular permission system based on user roles
- Role hierarchy: Admin > Instructor > Student
- Route-level access control using middleware
- Component-level rendering based on user permissions

### 🛡️ Security Features

- Password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Session invalidation on password change
- Secure password reset workflow

   - Batch selection for resource association

2. **Upload Workflow**:

   - Small files (<5MB): Direct upload to S3
   - Large files: Multipart upload with progress tracking
   - Automatic file type detection and categorization

3. **S3 Integration**:
   - Organized folder structure: `/batches/{batchName}/{resourceType}/{fileName}`
   - Secure file storage with encryption at rest
   - Automatic cleanup of incomplete multipart uploads

#### 🔒 Access Control

1. **Permission Management**:

   - Admins: Full access to all resources
